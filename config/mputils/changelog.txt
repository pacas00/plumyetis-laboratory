Lag Goggles - This is a mod that can be used by players to check lag in their own chunks. This will allow you to better 
              understand what kinds of items cause TPS drops. Very helpful for servers. I advise everyone to at least check it 
              out. 
              Please Note that there are two versions. One for Forge servers one for SpongeForge servers. If you run a server
              make sure to click the correct version.

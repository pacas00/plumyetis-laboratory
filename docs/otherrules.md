# Other Rules
* No begging
 * Asking nicely once or twice is acceptable
* No griefing, including but not limited to:
 * Destroying another player's constructions
 * Defacing another player's constructions
* No single tile towers (tear it down after you are done if you need one)
* No single tile holes - it's the number 1 rule in MineCraft! (fill it back up if you create one!)
* No hacking, this includes any sort of the following:
 * Using a hacked / non-official MineCraft client
 * Using any x-ray resource packs
 * Using any mods that are not included with the mod pack
* Don't exploit game mechanics
 * If you think it may be exploiting a mechanic, ask an OP first!
* No systems that run 24x7 without prior approval
 * If you have systems that can run forever make sure to turn it off before you log out
 * Make sure that the on/off switch is obvious. If you are offline and something you have 
   running is causing issues, an OP will attempt to turn it off. If we do not see how to
   we may destroy it.
 * No offensive builds, names, or skins
 * Don't build traps for other players
 * No scamming other players.
